This version works a little differently than the forge version due to lack of sound events. It runs entirely on the client and prevents sounds from being added to the sound manager via mixin. /listen is still a thing and ``/listen mute [sound]`` will automagically add the sounds to the muted sounds in the config file. Config is done though the use of the ClothConfigAPI, thus ClothConfig is a dependency. ModMenu Integration is a thing, and provides an in-game config menu and links to the curseforge page and the issue tracker.
